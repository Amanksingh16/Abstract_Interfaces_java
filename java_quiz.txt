JAVA CLASS 8 QUIZ

Ques 1 - True , as the interface acts and compiled like a normal class.


Ques 2 - The variable i cannot be private because all the variables defined inside Interfaces are static and they must be public 
           so every other derived classes could access and use its value.
		   
		   
Ques 3 - Yes , any number of interfaces can be implemented in a class .


Ques 4 - As the function methodX() is not set to be public , so the visibility of the inherited function is reduced from the interface. 
           This makes the compile time error.
		   

Ques 5 - 


Ques 6 - No , we cannot use keyword " abstract " in any of these cases. 
            1)   For Constructor , the visibility could only be public or protected and the constructor must be initialized at that current time 
			      and must have the body.
            2)   For Instance Initialization block , this block is executed even before the constructor so its 
			         body must be initialized at current time.  
            3)   Same for static block , at the time of object creation , this block executes . 
			

Ques 7 -  It is because the abstract functions don't have their initialization in same class only. They are empty and they are initialized in 
            the classes which inherits that abstract class. So it cannot be final as these functions are dynamic and they can be modified. 
			

Ques 8 - Yes, with the help of an inherited class of that abstract class , it can be done.
          By using this statement - 
             
			 Hello a = new Hello2();
                        
             where Hello is the abstract class and Hello2 is the derived class.

           But without making inherited class , it cannot be possible as abstract classes don't create objects.
